# Scope of Research
For PhD level, contribution expected at global/ world level

# What is Research
- Quantitative 
    - Def: use of mathematical models, softwares do statistical, formulaic or numerical analysis 
    - Approach: discovery, analysis, causal determination, prediction: or generalization of findings
    - Results: "This solution is N % better" 
- Qualitative
    - Def: use of non-numeric techniques
    - Approach: discovery, analogy, understanding, extrapolation of similar circumstances
    - Results: "This is a new problem and here is how to solve it"
- Pragmatic method & Mixed methods:
    - Generally problem given
    - Combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches
- Advocacy/ participatory research methods
    - Predefined agenda

# Approaches to CS Research
- Attack a known problem, find or compare tools to solve it
- Formalize a new problem, then attack it   

# Why Do We Cite Papers
- Relate our problem to prior work
- Add credibility
- Show that we know what is important in prior work, what is solved and what is open.
- Establish current state-of-the-art

# READ HIGH QUALITY PAPER  
- Tools
    - Google scholar
    - Microsoft academic research
    - Library
    - Research gate
- Criteria
    - Acceptance rate (for conference/...)
    - Total citations
    - Impact factors
    - Number of readers

# How To Read A Paper
- The browse (total 1-2 mins "gut check")
    - Go through 100-1000 papers a year 
    - To see interesting /relevant
    - Abstract + figures + captions 
    - Venuer check. Author Check. Citation check.

- The skim (5-10 mins max)
    - Believe the author and assume it's all true and decide if the paper is actually interesting and worth more exploration
    - Answer:
        - Category: type of paper
        - Context: what other papers is it related to? How related to your work?
        - Contribution
        - Credible
        - Care: will anyone care, given its valid? will it change anything?
        - Cost: time and effort cost you to read it carefully
    - 2-3 sencentences to say the addressed problem/ the new in solution/ how significant the experimentation/theory
- Critical read (1 hr)
    - Read carefully, but ignore details (e.g., proofs)
        - Note assumptions and question them
        - Analyze experiments/conclusions
        - Anslyze figures, diagrams, illustrations, graphs
        - Mark relevant unread references
        - Summary the main thrust and point out likely weakness in assumptions/methodology/experiments
    - Critically read
        - Understand
            - The problem
            - The proposed solution
            - The competing approaches/designs
            - The evaluation methodology
            - The comparison to state-of-the-art
        - Answer questions:
            - Is the problem carefully stated/ formulated? 
            - Is it a meaningful/ real problem? 
            - Is it the RIGHT problem (formulation vs description)?
            - Make a list of assumptions?
            - Novel about the problem formulation, if any
            - What well known problems are related or the same?
            - Are there simple solutions the authors do not seem to have considered?
            - Consider every divide, matrix op, function inversion, minimization (maximization) makes sense to you? Are assumptions justified?
            - What are the limitations of the soluation?
            - Is the logic of the paper clear and justifiable, given the assumptions?
            - Do all the pieces of their work fit together logically?
            - Has the right theorem been proven?
            - Are theorems logically supported? Are proofs given? Cited? If cited, how credible a source
            - If data is presented, did they gather the right data to substantiate their argument and did the data appear in the correct manner?
            - Did they have enough data to make a statistically sound decision?
            - Did they interpret the data in a reasonable manner?
            - Would other data be more compelling?
            - Did they compare with actual state-of-the-art performance?
            - What were the results? Did they do what they set out to do?
            - On what dimension did they advance the art?
            - Have the authors been cutting corners?
            - Would results be reproducable?
            - Problematic experimental setup?
            - Confounding factors
            - Unrealistic or artificial benchmarks?
            - Methodological misunderstanding?
            - Do the numbers add up?
            - Are the generalizations valid?
            - Are the claims modest enough?
    - Creatively read   
        - What is the novelty of the paper?
        - Does it open up new directions?
        - What are the good ideas in this paper? Can they can extended or generalized?
        - Could their ideas be combined with other approaches / your work?  
        - If there were other assumptions made, could that improve the approach? Could you ensure those assumptions were true for some problems?
        - Are there better numerical methods than what they are doing?
        - Are there possible improvements that make important practical differences?
        - If you were going to start doing research from this paper, what would be the next thing you would do?
